# U2.W5: Class Warfare, Validate a Credit Card Number


# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 2. Pseudocode

# Input: 16 digit integer
# Output: boolean, representing validity of credit card
# Steps:
#initialize class with 16 digit integer
	# raise error if length is not equal to 16
#def double_digit method
	#method should double every other digit of the 16 digits starting from the second to last
#define digit_sum
	# method should sum both skipped digits and doubled digits. 
	# splitting the integers with 2 digits		
#define valid?
	#determine if sum from above method is a multiple of 10
		#if true, return true
		#else, return false	


# 3. Initial Solution

# Don't forget to check on intialization for a card length
# of exactly 16 digits
class CreditCard
	def initia

end
