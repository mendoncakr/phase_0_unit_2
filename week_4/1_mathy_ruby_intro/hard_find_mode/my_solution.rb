# U2.W4: Calculate the mode!

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and 
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.  

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].

# 1. Pseudocode

#define mode method 
	# input is array
	# output is array
# create empty array called frequency that will hold amount of times # appears in list
# iterate through array
# for each number in array count # of appearances
# append to array
# find the higher number in the array (highest = most frequent)
# determine which number it is by index

# or

#define method mode 
#input for method is an array
#create empty hash called frequency
#iterate through list of #'s
	#set hash key equal to number at each index
	#set hash value to number of times # has been counted
#iterate through frequency list
	#find key/value pair with highest value
		#if only one frequent key
			#return key
		#elsif one or more most frequent keys
			#return all keys which tie
