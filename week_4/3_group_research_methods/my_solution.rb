# Identify and describe the ruby method you implemented. 
# For the array finding method I used the #include?() method. This method returns true or false if the given object
# is included in the array. Since this only returns a boolean, I iterated through the list and pushed the element to an empty
# list if it was included in the initial array.

# For the hash finding method, I used a very similar approach, I iterated through the array and if the value
# of the key matched the item I was looking for, then only did i push the 'thing_to_find' into my lists
